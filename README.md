## The Algorithm of Caculating Polygon Similarity 
### Description
The algorithm uses the shape variable between two polyshape objects to measure the similarity of their shapes (without considering rotation and scaling). A deformation close to 0 means that the two are almost the same. The larger the value, the greater the difference between the two shapes.
